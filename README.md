# FeedRiv

An open source, MIT licensed feed reader built with a custom PHP MVC backend framework and [TACE](https://www.agraddy.com/introducing-tace) for front end development. It focuses on giving you the tools you need to filter rss feeds and tag feed items. If you would like to use the hosted version, it is available at [FeedRiv - Feed Reader](https://www.feedriv.com).
